## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, **please report it privately**. Security issues should **not** be reported using GitHub Issues or any other public forum.

### How to Report Privately

To report a security vulnerability privately:

1. Go to the repository's **[Security Advisories](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories)** section.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide the necessary details about the vulnerability.

Your report will remain confidential, and we will respond as quickly as possible (usually within 48 hours) to evaluate the issue and work on a fix. We greatly appreciate your responsible disclosure.

Please **do not** report vulnerabilities through GitHub Issues, discussions, or other public channels as this could expose the issue to a wider audience before it is resolved.

### Security Fix Timeline

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will work to:
- Acknowledge the report within 48 hours.
- Investigate and confirm the issue.
- Develop a patch or mitigation strategy.
- Publish the fix and disclose the advisory publicly after the resolution.
